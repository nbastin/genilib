## Description
# This file has the configuration for a 2-by-3 grid topology, all nodes are from the "router" category
# The topology is created from a single aggregate, and the genretaed RSpec is unbounded
#
# The topology is like:
#  1 -- 2 -- 3
#  |    |    |
#  4 -- 5 -- 6
#
# The corresponding RSpec to this configuration file is 2by3-grid-1am.xml

[general]
# ---- Define Topology Type -------------------
# ring: ring topology
# grid: m-by-n grid topology
# mesh: fully mesh topology
# random: random topology
# custom: self defined topology
# lan: single multi-node LAN topology

topo_type=grid



# ---- Define Node Category -------------------

node_type=router



# ---- Aggregate Assignment -------------------
# This is to determine whether the topology is
# using single aggregate or multiple aggregates

single_am=yes



# ---- Using Stitching ------------------------
# This is only for crossing aggregates topology
# If use_stitching is set to yes, then the 
# links between stitching sites will be stitched,
# otherwise, all crossing aggregate links will 
# be EGRE links. 

#use_stitching=yes


# ---- RSpec File Name ------------------------

output_rspec=2by3-grid-1am.xml


# -- Configure Topology -----------------------

## Ring Topology
#[ring]
#num_nodes=10

## m-by-n Grid Topology
[grid]
num_row=2
num_col=3

## Fully Mesh Topology
#[mesh]
#num_nodes=5

## Random Topology
#[random]
#num_nodes=5
# this is the probablilty that a node can have a link to another node
#edge_prob=0.5


## Self defined topology
#[custom]
# Note: You can add one or more multi-node LANs to your regular topology defined in this section
# If you need to add LANs, you will have to configure the [add-lan] section
#edges=[(1,2),(2,3),(3,1)]


## LAN Topology
#[lan]
#num_nodes=10


## Add LAN (Optional)
# This section only needed when you need to add one or more multi-node LANs to your "custom" topology type
# To define additional LANs to your existing topology, you will need to format each LAN into a tuple of nodes 
# that are attached to the LAN, and one of the node should be included in your existing topology, so that the 
# LAN will be attached to your existing topology. 
# 
# For example:
# If your existing topology without LAN is [(1,2),(2,3), (3,1)], and you want to attch a three-node
# LAN to each node:
# You will need to define: 
#							lans = [(1,4,5),(2,6,7),(3,8,9)] 
# in this [add-lan] section.

#[add-lan]
#lans = 



# ---- Node Category ---------------------------
# You will create sections for your own node 
# categories, each category has four different 
# fields: 
# 		node_prefix, disk_image, install_service, execute_command, node_list
# 		
#
# The format of a section for a specific node 
# category is (assumeing the type is "host"):
# 
# [host]
# client_prefix=<host>
# disk_image=<url to the image>
# install_script=<url to the script tarball>, <path to the tarball>
# execute_cmd=<command>, <shell type>
# node_list=<a list of node belongs to this node category, i.e., ALL or 1, 2, 3, ...>

# ---- Assign Aggregaets ------------------------
# This section is only for multi-aggregate purpose
# 
# Here is a list of available InstaGENI Aggregates (sites)
# Stitching Sites can be found at http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GeniNetworkStitchingSites 
#
# You may need to enter the name of the InstaGENI site when a bounded RSpec is to be created.

# ==========================
#
# The syntax is <am_index>=<a list of noes>
# For example: 
# ig-gpo = 0, 1, 2 means that node 0,1,2 are all from ig-gpo

[am_nodes]
# If single_am = yes, and you would like to have unbounded RSpec
any=ALL

# If single_am = yes, and you would like to select one of the aggregate from the list, i.e. select ig-gpo, 
# then, you enter ig-gpo=ALL
#ig-gpo=ALL
