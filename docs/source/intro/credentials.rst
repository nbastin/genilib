Credentials
===========

Using `geni-lib` to interact with cloud / testbed resources requires credentials for your account
with a given provider (GENI, CloudLab, Emulab, etc.).  The following guides provide documentation
for how to acquire the credentials that `geni-lib` needs for each environment.

.. note::
  If you only want to use geni-lib to manipulate XML resource files (RSpecs) to use with another
  tool, you do not need to install any credentials
