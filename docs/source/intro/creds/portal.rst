Getting Credentials from the NSF GENI Portal
============================================

========================
Download The omni.bundle
========================

You need a file called ``omni.bundle`` which is available from the GENI Portal web
interface.  Once you log into the GENI Portal you can use the following steps to locate your
``omni.bundle`` download:

* At the top of the Portal home page click on the tab labeled **Profile**
* In the tabs on the Profile page click on the one labeled **Configure omni**
* Embedded in the text under the **Option 1: Automatic omni configuration** header, there
  is a button labeled **Download your omni data**.  Click this button.

.. note::
  If you see a warning that no SSH keys have been uploaded you can still use the bundle, but
  you will need to specify an SSH public key path later if you want to use resources that
  require SSH login

* Click the **Download your omni data** button at the bottom of the next page and it should
  start downloading immediately in your browser.
