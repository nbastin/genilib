Creating and Managing Slice Credentials
=======================================

This example will walk you through creating a number of slices within a single project
and assigning individual project members to each slice.  This is a common use case for
a classroom instructor, allowing class members to have their own slices while not being
able to interact with those of other members.

.. note::
  You may skip any of the below steps that you might have executed using another interface
  (e.g. the GENI Portal or Cloudlab Web Interface).
